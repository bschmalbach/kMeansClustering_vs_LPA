# kMeansClustering versus Latent Profile Analysis

The original goal of this exercise was to establish clusters of red versus white wine, based on properties internal properties such as alcohol content, sulfur content, acidity, etc.

k Means Clustering was the proposed method, but it performed poorly in both training and testing data sets, with accuracies of below 80%.

A better alternative is Latent Profile Analysis (using mclust). Here accuracy was in excess of 98% for both data sets.
